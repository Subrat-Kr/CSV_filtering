# CSV_filtering
This repository contains a Python script that filters a CSV file based on a list of selected image names present in a folder, and saves the filtered data to another CSV file using the Pandas library.


This repository provides a Python script for introducing pairflip noise into the Bach dataset. Pairflip noise is a type of label noise that involves flipping labels between pairs of classes in a dataset. In the context of the Bach dataset, this noise can be introduced by swapping the labels between classes and can be generalize to any other datasets.
